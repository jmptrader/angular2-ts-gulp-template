/*
* General Guideline:
* A state is something that augments and overrides all other styles. 
* For example, an accordion section may be in a collapsed or expanded state. 
* A message may be in a success or error state.
* States are generally applied to the same element as a layout rule or applied to the same element as a base module class.
* States should be made to stand alone and are usually built of a single class selector.
* Since the state will likely need to override the style of a more complex rule set, the use of !important is allowed
