/*
* General Guideline:
* Layout styles can be divided into major and minor styles based on reuse. 
* Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally styled using ID selectors 
* Take the time to think about the elements that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors where appropriate.
* Generally, a Layout style only has a single selector: a single ID or class name
